# Route53 Hook for Dehydrated
This hook will allow you to handle DNS-01 authentication for Let's Encrypt requests using AWS' Route53 DNS hosting. Based on the original script by
rmarchei (https://gist.github.com/rmarchei/98489c05f0898abe612eec916508f2bf), with fixes for new hooks.

## Requirements
This hook requires the AWS CLI to be installed and configured.
